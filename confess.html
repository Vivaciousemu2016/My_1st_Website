			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>Hi, this is Alex. Well, hello there! You've stumbled upon the 'About Me' section, so let me introduce myself. I'm the guy next door with a serious passion for cooking up a storm in the kitchen. When I'm not whipping up a delicious meal, you'll find me indulging in my love for learning new languages - which comes in handy when I'm trying to decode the menu at an exotic restaurant.

				Now, you might think that's all there is to me, but hold your horses! I'm also a cat-person (but don't worry, I won't try to steal your feline friend), and a self-proclaimed music lover who can't resist belting out a tune or two in the shower.
				
				Oh, and did I mention that I'm literally right next door? Yep, you heard it right. So if you ever find yourself in need of a cup of sugar or some company for dinner, just give me a shout!
				
				But enough about me, let's get to know each other better over a delicious meal and some cat memes. Sound good? シ</p>

			<h2>My Feelings</h2>
			<p>Hey Xiaolin, I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now, but I haven't had the courage to say it. I just wanted to let you know that I really like you. You're smart, funny, and kind, and every time we talk, I feel like I'm getting to know someone truly special. I don't know if you feel the same way, but I just couldn't keep this to myself any longer. If you're interested, I'd love to take you out on a date and get to know you better.</p>
